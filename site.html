  <h1>How do I date you ?</h1>
  <h2>Research suggests that falling in love with your best friend is more normal than you think... Ending up developing strong feelings for your best friend is more normal than it seems. You spend a lot of time together, you talk in the best and last moments, you help each other, you love each other and then, when you realize it, this love is already growing.
 People generally don't want to start a relationship with their bff because this “best friend” is their best friend and this can ruin the friendship, the question is: “DOES A KISS RUIN A FRIENDSHIP?”</h2>
